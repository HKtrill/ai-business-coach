## **Yesterday**
- Experimented with advanced **interaction-based feature engineering**  
  *(e.g., `Contract-Weighted Cost`, `M2M No Soft Anchor`)*  
- Assessed **feature importance** (via Random Forest) and **pruned low-signal contributors**.  
- Confirmed the **LR → RF → RNN cascade** remains the **optimal architecture** for stability.  
- **Minimized precision loss** while maintaining **model stability on unseen data**.

---

## **Today**
- Implemented **advanced geometric feature set**  
  *(e.g., `normalized_churn_distance`, `temporal_risk`, `geometric_confidence_score`)*.  
- Successfully used **geometric confidence scores** to define and inform **dynamic prediction thresholds**.  
- Maintained **model stability** while significantly reducing **uncertain false positive cases**.

---

## **🚧 Roadblocks**
- **104 high-confidence False Positives (FPs)** remain.  
  - Mean confidence: **0.729**  
  - These cases are **resistant to geometric separation**, **mimicking churn behavior** almost perfectly.

## **📊 Findings**
| Metric | Before | After | Δ Change |
|:-------|:-------:|:------:|:--------:|
| **Precision (Churn)** | 49.34% | **60.05%** | 🔺 +10.71 pts |
| **Accuracy** | 72.89% | **78.99%** | 🔺 +6.10 pts |
| **PR-AUC** | 0.632 | **0.632** | ➖ Stable |
| **Recall** | 79.41% | **62.30%** | 🔻 -17.11 pts |

**Major Breakthrough:**  
- Precision increase of **+10.71 percentage points**, marking a **practical improvement** in churn identification.  

**Model Efficiency:**  
- Accuracy improved notably without overfitting — PR-AUC stability indicates **strong generalization**.  

**Geometric Efficacy:**  
- The **new geometric features** sharpened the **decision boundary**, removing most low-confidence FPs.  

**Trade-off:**  
- **Recall decreased**, but the precision gain transforms the model into a **deployable, business-relevant tool**.

---

## **🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan**
- Conduct a **deep-dive analysis** on the **104 remaining high-confidence FPs**.  
- Investigate **distinct feature patterns** in these stubborn cases using **clustering** and **temporal analysis**.  
- Develop **business rule overlays** and explore **cost-sensitive learning** approaches tailored to this **problematic segment**.
- Tryout new innovative ways to transform the data into generalizable components while improving overall model performance.
